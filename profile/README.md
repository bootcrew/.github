## Operating system images for Bootc

This organization is meant to be an incubation space for packaging and testing [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc)'s [composefs-native backend](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/issues/1190) on many different environments following best practices wherever possible. We aim to find out exactly what is required to get a generally functional system on them then submitting them upstream.

Feel free to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/aj4K4zsuUx) or talk on the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/bootcrew/discussions) for talking about this project.
